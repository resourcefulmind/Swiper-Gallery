# Swiper-Gallery
Currently learning how to use the swiper library and it's beautiful functionalites to create awesome image carousels and then use it to make something nice in my portfolio website

I used laguages such as:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

I also gained some proficiency in
- Swiper
- Popmotion

In this short project, I explored with the aid of the FrontEndMasters bootcamp, the swiper gallery and added to my skills in terms of
- Learning the basics and the use of third-party libraries
- Learning how to modify third party javascript libraries and fit them to my use.
- Exploring their syntax and documentation to be able to understand what I am doing
- Examining the fundamentals of popmotion and understanding how to implement popmotion into my code.
- Debugging Popmotion functions.

I hope someone else who doesn't know about FrontEndMasters finds this code useful and improves their skill as well.
